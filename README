~ BUILD INSTRUCTIONS ~

If you dont have CMAKE installed, install that.
Run the command: cmake . 
Run the following command: make

Current tests will spawn binaries with an rle_test* naming convention 

Currently, build only works on linux (tested on latest verison of GCC/CMake). To make it work on windows, you'd have to manually link
    librle withWindows SDL/lua5.3.
